# Toodoo

This is a repository for the challenge sent by FESC. The challenge consists of a simple To-do List.

The project was developed using Vue, integrated together with localStorage and moment.js.

The development consisted primarily of prototyping the screen using Figma (the file can be found in `./sources`), and after that developed the entire application using the chosen framework.

## To start the application

### Install the dependencies
```
yarn
```

### Start the development server
```
yarn serve
```

Now you can visit `localhost:8080` from your browser.
